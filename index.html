        <section>Parallax scrolling is a web site trend where the background content (i.e. an image) is moved at a
            different speed than the foreground content while scrolling. Click on the links below to see the difference
            between a website with and without parallax scrolling.
            Note: Parallax scrolling does not always work on mobile devices/smart phones. However, you can use media
            queries to turn off the effect on mobile devices (see last example on this page).
            In this website we used two .png images to create a 3D illusion which is basically called Parallax effect.
